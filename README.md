# Resize Magic.

> An implementation of the Seam Carving algorithm in JavaScript. Seam carving
   allows for smart resizing of images based on content. Instead of removing 
   block chunks from the boarders of the images, seams - 1 pixel wide paths - 
   are dynamically removed allowing for important content in the image to 
   remain. _Read more here_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving.
